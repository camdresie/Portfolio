              p.lead
                | I operate with a high-trust, outcome-focused management style that creates highly collaborative and psychologically safe environments where every voice is valued. I believe in giving my team autonomy to approach their work in the way they see fit while providing clear goals and the context that connects their work to our broader business strategy.

                  h4 Clarity & Alignment
                  p I ensure teams have clear direction and understand how their work connects to broader company goals. Regular communication about priorities, context, and decision-making rationale helps everyone make better autonomous decisions.

                  h4 Growth Mindset
                  p I invest in my team's professional development through stretch assignments, mentoring, and creating safe spaces to experiment and learn from failures. Everyone should leave our team better than when they joined.

                  h4 Psychological Safety
                  p Teams perform best when they can bring their authentic selves to work, voice concerns without fear, and take calculated risks. I foster an environment where diverse perspectives are valued and healthy debate is encouraged.

                  h4 Empowered Autonomy
                  p I provide context and guardrails, then trust my team to execute. Micromanagement stifles creativity and growth. I focus on outcomes and impact rather than prescriptive processes.

                  h4 Data-Driven Decisions
                  p While intuition matters, I emphasize making decisions based on user research, metrics, and market insights. I teach teams to identify the right metrics to track and how to interpret data meaningfully.

                  h4 Continuous Improvement
                  p Regular retrospectives, feedback loops, and process iteration are essential. I model intellectual humility by being open about my own mistakes and showing how failure drives learning and improvement.

                  h4 Empowerment & Ownership
                  p I emphasize empowerment and ownership, expecting PMs to lead their team's direction with support from leadership. I want my team to feel like they are building their careers while building great products, with the confidence that they have both the space to operate and the support to succeed.

                  h4 Discovery & Experimentation
                  p I encourage my team to engage in discovery and experimentation, share learnings openly, and challenge assumptions as we develop products. Innovation comes from creating safe spaces to test ideas and learn from both successes and failures.
