                  | I'm a Group Product Manager and attorney who brings my utmost to every project I work on. Throughout my career, I've gained a vast array of technical and business competencies that I employ to build features that will delight users. 
                p
                  | I currently work as a Group Product Manager at Ontra, where I lead product strategy for our flagship division and manage a team of Product Managers developing AI-powered solutions for the legal industry. Prior to my time at Ontra, I worked as an engineer with Stack Moxie, an enterprise-grade solution for automated testing of marketing operations tech stacks.
                p
                  | Working as a software engineer with Stack Moxie, I quickly proved myself to be capable of managing large-scale projects independently. In my time with the company, I shipped three entirely new, full-stack features on which I handled all aspects of development. In my development work, I combine a commitment to strong technical foundations, a focus on excellent user experience, and a passion for clean design to craft features that have scaled to serve all Stack Moxie's clients, from small startups to enterprise-grade giants. 
                p
                  | In addition to the native features I developed for Stack Moxie, I also developed integrations with partners including Salesforce, Amplitude, and others. To achieve seamless integrations, I worked hand-in-hand with outside development teams at other companies, utilizing my communication skills to provide the projects with direction and effectively convey technical requirements to outside teams. The integrations I developed brought partners' features into the Stack Moxie ecosystem and integrated Stack Moxie's testing functionalities into other applications. 
                p
                  | I also assisted in managing the cloud infrastructure on which Stack Moxie runs. I handled several aspects of our migration from AWS to Azure including creating the CI/CD process, configuring deployment pipelines, migrating to Azure Service Bus, and preparing to migrate fully onto an Azure-hosted regime instead of Heroku in the future. 
                p
                  | Prior to becoming an engineer, I attained my law degree from Washington University in St. Louis and worked as a legal consultant for firms and startups specifically on issues around data privacy, including GDPR and CCPA, corporate formation, and regulatory and compliance issues. I maintain an active California Bar license. 
                p
                  | In my free time I'm an avid runner and reader, dog dad to Koda (a black labradoodle), husband to Lucas, and love to play videogames. To get a feel for my capabilities, please check out some of the projects I've completed as displayed on this site or visit my Github!

                  p.lead
                    | I believe in supportive leadership that empowers teams to do their best work while fostering growth, autonomy, and psychological safety.

                      h4 Clarity & Alignment
                      p I ensure teams have clear direction and understand how their work connects to broader company goals. Regular communication about priorities, context, and decision-making rationale helps everyone make better autonomous decisions.

                      p I invest in my team's professional development through stretch assignments, mentoring, and creating safe spaces to experiment and learn from failures. Everyone should leave our team better than when they joined.

                      p Teams perform best when they can bring their authentic selves to work, voice concerns without fear, and take calculated risks. I foster an environment where diverse perspectives are valued and healthy debate is encouraged.

                      h4 Empowered Autonomy
                      p I provide context and guardrails, then trust my team to execute. Micromanagement stifles creativity and growth. I focus on outcomes and impact rather than prescriptive processes.

                      p While intuition matters, I emphasize making decisions based on user research, metrics, and market insights. I teach teams to identify the right metrics to track and how to interpret data meaningfully.

                      p Regular retrospectives, feedback loops, and process iteration are essential. I model intellectual humility by being open about my own mistakes and showing how failure drives learning and improvement.
