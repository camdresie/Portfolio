            | My journey to becoming a full stack developer began in a non-traditional way: in law school. While at Washington University in St. Louis School of Law, I focused a great deal of my legal education on startups. Learning about technology in the context of emerging growth companies got me interested in learning more about software development.

            | This eventually led me to use my law degree to assist a technology recruiting company in building out a legal division. Being surrounded with technical recruiters further stoked my interest in technology and I decided to begin teaching myself to code.

            | Fast forward to the present, and I have attained a strong full stack development skillset that would make me an asset to any company in a junior development role. I am a highly capable individual and would bring value to any technical team due to my technical skillset, legal background, and ability to quickly learn new skills. To get a feel for my capabilities, please check out some of the projects I've completed as displayed on this site, or feel free to visit my Github to see a full list of projects I've completed!
