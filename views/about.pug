            | I’m a software engineer and attorney who brings my utmost to every project I work on. Throughout my career, I’ve gained a vast array of technical and business competencies that I employ to achieve development goals.

            | Working as a software engineer with Stack Moxie, I quickly proved myself to be capable of managing large-scale projects independently. In my first year with the company, I’ve shipped three entirely new, full-stack features on which I handled all aspects of development, one of which is now among the most popular features in the app. In my development work, I combine a commitment to strong technical foundations, a focus on excellent user experience, and a passion for clean design to craft features that have scaled to serve all Stack Moxie’s clients, from small startups to enterprise-grade giants.

            br
            | In addition to the native features I develop for Stack Moxie, I also develop integrations with partners including Salesforce, Welcome Software, Amplitude, and others. To achieve seamless integrations, I work hand-in-hand with outside development teams at other companies, utilizing my communication skills to provide the projects with direction and effectively convey technical requirements to outside teams. The integrations I develop bring partners’ features into the Stack Moxie ecosystem and integrate Stack Moxie’s testing functionalities into other applications. 
            br
            br
            | I also assist in managing the cloud infrastructure on which Stack Moxie runs. I have handled several aspects of our migration from AWS to Azure including creating the CI/CD process we now use, configuring deployment pipelines, migrating to Azure Service Bus, and preparing to migrate fully onto an Azure-hosted regime instead of Heroku in the future. 
            br
            br
            | Prior to becoming an engineer, I attained my law degree from Washington University in St. Louis and worked as a legal consultant for firms and startups specifically on issues around data privacy, including GDPR and CCPA, corporate formation, and regulatory and compliance issues. I maintain an active California Bar license. 
            br

            | In my free time I’m an avid runner and reader, dog dad to Koda (a black labradoodle), fiancé to Lucas, and love to play videogames. To get a feel for my capabilities, please check out some of the projects I've completed as displayed on this site, visit my Github, or check out Stack Moxie!
