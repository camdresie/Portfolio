        | I'm a Masters in Computer and Information Technology student at the University of Pennsylvania. This is a portfolio to showcase some of the projects on which I've worked! Each project tile has a live link where you can try out the project for yourself, as well as a link to its individual github repo. To learn more about me, navigate to my bio via the "Learn More" button. The projects showcased here display a wide range of technologies, including Java, C, HTML, CSS, JavaScript, node.js, Express.js, and more! Thanks for visiting my portfolio!
