          | I'm a Staff Product Manager at Ontra, where I lead the development of AI-powered solutions for the legal industry. With a unique background combining law (J.D. from Washington University in St. Louis) and technology (Master's in Computer Science from UPenn), I bridge the gap between technical innovation and legal expertise. This portfolio showcases some of my personal projects that demonstrate my hands-on technical capabilities across various technologies including JavaScript, Swift, node.js, Java, Python, and more.
