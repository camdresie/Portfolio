        | I'm a Product Manager at Ontra and Masters in Computer and Information Technology student at the University of Pennsylvania. This is a portfolio to showcase some of my personal projects. Each project tile has a live link where you can try out the project for yourself (if it's not a console app), as well as a link to its individual github repo. To learn more about me, navigate to my bio via the "Learn More" button. The projects showcased here display a wide range of technologies including JavaScript, Swift, node.js, Java, Python, and more! Thanks for visiting my portfolio!
