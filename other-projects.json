"description": "This project takes in an array of quotes with information pertinent to those quotes (who said it, where they said it, when they said it, and a category for the quote). The function in the program then randomizes the quotes and selects one. As it does this, the background color for the page changes to a random color. If a user doesn't hit the button to get a random quote within ten seconds, the page will automatically select a new random quote.",
