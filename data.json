This project implements a minimax algorithm with alpha-beta pruning to create an AI that is capable of playing a dominoes game. The game is played by two players, one a human and the other the AI. One player always places dominoes vertically, the other horizontally. The AI allows a player to enter a number to specify how many moves ahead it should search in the minimax tree of possibilities, 1 being the least and 9 the most. If the game looks 9 moves into the future, it is exceedingly hard to beat. It examines all possible outcomes to determine the most optimal play for it, assuming fully optimal play by the human player. If the human player makes an error, it is even easier for the AI to win.

I was also involved in wireframing the idea and doing feature research on how best to implement it. Published Values is a feature that allows users of the Stack Moxie testing framework to use a list of values to run test cases against. This is particularly useful in contexts where a value could be any one of a large set of values. Rather than testing against each individual value or entering the values one-by-one, published values allow the user to create lists once and use them multiple times. The feature also connects with a user's Salesforce Global Picklist values, which allows them to test against Salesforce values if they have a connection. In addition, the feature notifies users when Salesforce Global Picklist values have changed, exposing critical information to marketing team members who don't always have Admin access to their company's Salesforce instance, but do rely on the data in global picklists to conduct their daily tasks. New or updated values are intelligently retrieved once per day and cached using Redis.",

It is appended to the DOM using vanilla JavaScript. There are two event listeners, one on the search button and one on the search text input field. As a user types, the search function dynamically searches through each name on the list to see if there are any matches. If the user inputs a string of text that matches a user's name in entirety or in part, the function displays that name and hides all others. If no matches are found, a message is displayed telling the user to try another name as no matches were found.",

Or, if you're like me, and lose the dice that come with Yahtzee!, this app will provide a replacement so you can continue to play. The app is written in Swift and makes use of the Main Storyboard for the UI layout and the View Controller to control the display of the dice and the roll button functionality. To use the app, a user simply hits the roll button and random pairs of dice are displayed.",
